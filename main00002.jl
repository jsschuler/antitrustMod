### Model Description ####

# Agents have preferences for privacy meaning their bliss point is somewhere between the 
# expected wait time for a result given perfect information and the expected wait time for 
# a result given uniform information.

# agents also have a parameter  determining how often they "Act" (try a new search engine)
# The possible actions depend on the environment 
    # if a data sharing law is available, agents can copy their data across search engines 
    # if a data deletion rule is available, agents may delete their data 
    # agents can switch across any available search engines 

# agents are connected by a network. When an agent undertakes an action, adjacent agents in the network also try the action 
# and maintain it if they prefer it.

# let's test some objects
include("objects3.jl")
# include global parameters
include("globals.jl")

# now, all actions work through aliases. 
# if an agent decides to use a VPN, it simply generates a new alias. 
# if an agent requests deletion, it removes records of its alias from the search engine. 
# if an agent requests data sharing, it transfers its alias data to another search engine
